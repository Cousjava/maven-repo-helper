### mh\_install:

Usage:

    mh_install [option]...

Reads the file debian/$package.poms and installs each POM file listed in the .poms file, as well as the associated jars - assuming that at least the --artifact option is given in the .poms file for all jars to install.

Options:

    -h --help: show this text
    -V --version: show the version
    -p<package> --package=<package>: name of the Debian package which will contain all the files to install
    -e<version>, --set-version=<version>: set the version for all artifacts, do not use the version declared in the POM files.
    -r<rules> --rules=<rules>: path to the file containing the rules to apply when cleaning the POM files.
      Optional, the default location is debian/maven.rules
    -u<rules> --published-rules=<rules>: path to the file containing the extra rules to publish in the property debian.mavenRules in the cleaned POM.
      Optional, the default location is debian/maven.publishedRules
    -i<rules> --ignore-rules=<rules>: path to the file containing the rules used to remove certain dependencies from the cleaned POM.
      Optional, the default location is debian/maven.ignoreRules
    --no-publish-used-rule: don't publish the rule used to transform a POM's own attributes in debian.mavenRules
    -v --verbose: show more information while running
    -n --no-act: don't actually do anything, just print the results

The $package.poms file must contain enough information to locate the jar files to install, and to associate them with their POM file.
For each POM file associated with a jar, we need to supply at least the --artifact parameter. For example:

maven-debian-helper.poms:

    pom.xml --no-parent --has-package-version
    maven-debian-helper/pom.xml --has-package-version --artifact=maven-debian-helper/target/maven-debian-helper-*.jar --java-lib
    maven-debian-plugin/pom.xml --has-package-version --artifact=maven-debian-plugin/target/maven-debian-plugin-*.jar --java-lib
    maven-build-nodocs/pom.xml --has-package-version --artifact=maven-build-nodocs/target/maven-build-nodocs-*.jar --java-lib
    maven-packager-utils/pom.xml --has-package-version --artifact=maven-packager-utils/target/maven-packager-utils-*.jar --java-lib

Here we tell mh\_install to deploy the maven-debian-helper project and its sub projects into /usr/share/maven-repo,
and to deploy all jars also into /usr/share/java (--java-lib option)

Internally, mh\_installpom is used to install the POM file, mh\_installjar is used to install the jar if --artifact is supplied.
If a project or sub-project contains the file src/site/site.xml, then it will be installed with mh\_installsite.
