Description: Helper tools for including Maven metatada in Debian packages
 Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the
 concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build,
 reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
 .
 Maven's primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete
 state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. In order to
 attain this goal there are several areas of concern that Maven attempts
 to deal with:
 .
    * Making the build process easy
    * Providing a uniform build system
    * Providing quality project information
    * Providing guidelines for best practices development
    * Allowing transparent migration to new features
 .
 This package enables Debian packages which are not using Maven in their
 build process to provide and install Maven POMs and libraries in the
 repository located in /usr/share/maven-repo.
 .
 Packages built with Maven (using maven-debian-helper) will benefit as
 many of their dependencies are already packaged in Debian but they are
 missing the necessary metadata (Maven POM) which is required by Maven
 when it is using dependencies.
