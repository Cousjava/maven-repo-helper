maven-repo-helper (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add more unit tests
  * maven.ignoreRules now supports eliminating some plugins from the build
  * maven.rules can be used to repair missing version numbers for
    plugins and extensions as well as dependencies (Closes: #561420) 
  * If a pom file is followed by the --ignore option in the file
    <package>.poms, then it is ignored from the build and all operations
    (cleaning, patching)
  * Add support for maven.cleanIgnoreRules to ignore additional dependencies or
    plugins during the clean phase.
  * mh_cleanpom automatically adds a published rule for any Maven plugin, this
    rule is used later by maven-debian-helper to force the versions of the
    Maven plugins used in a pom.xml file with the versions defined in the
    repository
  * Read rules from the Maven repository to force the version of
    Maven plugins to be  the same as in the repository
  * Add --debian-build and --no-docs-build options to mh_patchpoms to remove
    some elements from the POM during a Debian build

  * org/debian/maven/repo/POMReader.java:

maven-repo-helper (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * org/debian/maven/repo/POMReader.java:
    Fix ${parent.version} parsing inside child's pom.xml
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no changes needed)
  * Fix Vcs-* fields: use pkg-java SVN repository

maven-repo-helper (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Install jars in /usr/share/java and create link to them from
    the Maven repository (as suggested by Marcus Better)
  * Add a new script, mh_linkjar, which creates links to the jar into
    /usr/share/maven-repo. Unlike mh_installjar, it does not copy the
    jar into the build directory.
  * Use install instead of dh_install in the scripts as it can
    interfer if there is a .install file in the debian folder.
  * Add Recommends: debhelper as debhelper is used in some scripts
    (mh_install* and mh_linkjar)
  * Add --set-version to mh_cleanpom, mh_installpom, mh_installpoms
    to be able to force the version of the artifact in Maven without
    needing patching the original POM file.
  * More errors detected in repo scan
  * Use http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4_0_0.xsd as the location of
    the xsd in the xml namespace declaration to keep gcj happy. It should
    not affect Maven or other tools, provided that the xsd is registered
    in a XML catalog.
  * By default, remove the test dependencies from cleaned POMs (except for
    multi-module POM) as they are not useful outside building the project
    itself most of the time and they make checking consistency in the 
    Maven repository harder.
  * mh_cleanpom, mh_installpom(s) and mh_transformpoms can remove 
    dependencies from the POM files

maven-repo-helper (0.6.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add a workaround to use gcj with maven-repo-helper:
    avoid using gnu xml stream when reading or writing XML documents.

maven-repo-helper (0.6) experimental; urgency=low

  * Move mh_genrules scripts to the maven-debian-helper package,
    as it needs mh_lspoms and other components from this package.
  * Repair missing version information on dependencies
